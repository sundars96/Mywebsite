# 👋 Hey there, I’m Sundar!!!

🚀 A curious mind with a business hustle and a data muscle.

I started my career steering multimillion-dollar growth in India’s booming edtech sector — leading 140+ rockstars, closing deals, and optimizing operations like a boss. 📈 But I didn’t stop there.

Now, I’m in Boston 🐾 chasing my next big adventure — diving deep into data, analytics, and decision science through my **MS in Applied Business Analytics** at Boston University. I’m on a mission to **turn raw data into business gold** — be it through dashboards, Python models, or stakeholder strategies.

## 🎯 What Drives Me?

I’m obsessed with creating *systems that scale* — whether it’s a GTM playbook for a solar startup or a predictive salary model. I believe in blending storytelling + data + design to drive change.

My goals?
- Help businesses **see clearly**, act faster, and grow smarter  
- Work with global teams that value **clarity, creativity, and courage**  
- Keep learning, keep building, and keep drinking good coffee ☕
